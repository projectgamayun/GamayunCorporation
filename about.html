      <h1>About Gamayun</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32"><em>So, what made you come up with the idea for Gamayun in the first place?</em></h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey"><h4>Anger</h4>

      <p>I'm not gonna lie, it was anger. OK, maybe if I'm being generous <em>frustration</em> but the bottom line was I'd heard one too many relatively young practitioners come up with this 'totally novel' idea...that was really something someone else had come up with 10 years prior, that was an extension of something someone else had done 20 years ago. I've been witnessing the same phenomenon happen month after month, year after year, and wondering what in the world was wrong with us? How can we be so focused on the science of security, but be the least scientific in organization and operation?</p>
      <p>One obvious factor is that unlike a lot of other fields, anyone can buy a computer, learn some code, and start to poke around in the innards of software and hardware. Its a little more difficult to become a basement bio-chemist, or nuclear physicist, what with the expense associated with equipment and supplies, and the questions from the FBI about the supplies...and the EPA about the leftovers.</p>
      <p>As a scientific discipline we're also very small. Practically an also-ran to our big brothers in computer science and engineering, which is why we don't have our own dedicated repository. And that's just the academic side of things; there are thousands of corporate researchers whose findings may never leave the corporate network, and thousands more independent researchers whose work <em>might</em> look something like an academic paper, but it is just as likely to be a crappy slide deck and some cryptic speaker notes. Sure, its the work that counts, but what's the point of publishing research findings if only you and two other people can figure out what you're talking about?</p>
      <p>If you want to be a PhD in physics, you can look up all the physics, in a reasonable amount of time, and find a sliver of a slice of a subject that hasn't been tackled; if you want to break ground in cybersecurity your ability to have a comprehensive understanding of what came before is so handicapped as to be nearly impossible. Don't take my word for it, ask any major security conference CFP board what percentage of submissions are someone stumbling unawares onto the work of someone who came before?</p>
      <p>More to the point, without a concerted effort to capture and make accessible security research, we run the risk of outright forgetting what came before. Conferences (and their proceedings) come and go. People take down web sites and git repos for various reasons. The Wayback Machine doesn't capture everything, and we shouldn't have to rely on a general purpose archiving effort to preserve such an important set of information. If we have a talent shortage in this field, shouldn't we be doing everything we can to ensure that rare talent spends it time working on the novel, or making new contribution, vice reinventing the wheel?</p>

       <p class="w3-text-grey"><h4>The Unglamorous Life</h4>

      <p>Building and maintaining an archive is probably the least exciting thing one can do in the security field, but based on early feedback it is something that is clearly needed. I mean the only thing nerdier than a computer geek, is a book worm. But given the ubiquity of computer technology in our lives, and the persistence of connectivity, can we really afford not to make the effort, no matter the lack of sex appeal? </p>
