      <h1>What is Project Gamayun?</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">The Gamayun is a creature from Slavic mythology that would issue prophecies because she had access to all knowledge. The idea behind Project Gamayun ("Gamayun") is to help capture and make as much cybersecurity knowledge, regardless of source, readily available and accessible as possible.</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey"><h4>Why?</h4>

      <p>Do you know what the state of the art in any security discipline is? You know what you know, and what some friends and colleagues know, but before you embark on a new project do you do a literature review? That's a thing academics do to help ensure that what they want to do is either novel, or something that builds on the work of others. Do you know how many people in all the universities in all the world are working on security problems? Have you read all their papers? Have you gone to every security conference everywhere in the world (something like 2000 and counting) to keep abreast of the latest and greatest?

      <p>Of course not, that's ridiculous. Its an impossible task.

      <p>Well, its impossible now. One of the goals of Gamayun is to make it entirely possible. If we're successful, Gamayun should:
<ul>
    <li>Be the largest single repository of security research in the world.</li>
    <li>"Augment" that content (or descriptions thereof) to varying degrees, with metadata and other content to help make it more readily discoverable and understandable.</li>
    <li>Make it possible to for researchers, solution developers, and others to more effectively consume larger quantities of research.</li>
    <li>Make it easier for researchers around the world to find each other and collaborate (no more wheel re-invention).</li>
    <li>Ensure that researchers get their work distributed as widely as possible so that it can be put to effective use as we build a safer and more secure cyberspace.</li>
</ul>

      <h4>What Gamayun is Not</h4>

      <p>We are not Sci-Hub. While we understand the motivation for such an effort (academic publishing is basically a racket), we're not down with piracy. We will work within existing legal regimes to gain the appropriate permissions and rights to use and augment the work of researchers whether they are in academia, industry, or independents.</p>

      <p>We are not Academia.edu. We wish we'd been first, but we're grateful for the lessons learned. There is no VC money behind this project (and the corresponding expectation of growth at all costs). At this point we rely on volunteers and donations (and some self-funding). The paperwork to become a 501(c)(3) is in the works. The goal is that all participants in Gamayun are compensated to some degree for their effort and energy.</p>

      <h4>Interested?</h4>

      <p>Starting anything new and sufficiently different is a scary and challenging experience. No one can do it alone and stay healthy (or sane). To succeed, Gamayun needs help from a wide variety of people: engineers, librarians, editors, and security practitioners. If you're interested in lending a hand, and getting in on the ground floor, please drop a line to support@gamayun.org</p>


      * Look, we know some of you don't like the terms 'cybersecurity' or 'cyberspace'. We came up when it was computer security and information security and information assurance, so we get it. But the number of people who use the term as shorthand outnumber those who don't, so we're going to save our energy for the fights that matter.
