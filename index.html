      <h2>Why A Cybersecurity Research Repository?</h2>

      <p>Do you know what the state of the art is in any security discipline? You know what you know, and what some friends and colleagues know, but before you start a new research project do you do a literature review? That's a thing academics do to understand what's been done before. It helps ensure that what they end up doing is either novel, or something that builds on the work of others in a meaningful fashion. Do you know how many people in all the universities or corporations in all the world are working on the same problem you are? Have you read all their papers? Do you actually read every abstract or summary of every entry on all 117 pages of your Google foo results?  Have you gone to the library to look for work that hasn't been digitized yet? Have you gone to every security conference everywhere in the world (something like 2000 - annually - and counting) to keep abreast of the latest developments?

      <p><em>Of course not, that's ridiculous. Its an impossible task.</em>

      <p>Well, its impossible <b>now.</b> One of the goals of Gamayun in general and CISRR in particular is to make it entirely possible. If we're successful, CISRR should, among other things:
<ul>
    <li>Be the largest single repository of security research in the world.</li>
    <li>"Augment" that content (or descriptions thereof) to varying degrees, with metadata and other content to help make it more readily discoverable and understandable.</li>
    <li>Make it possible to for researchers, solution developers, investors, and others to more effectively consume larger quantities of pertinent research.</li>
    <li>Make it easier for researchers around the world to find each other and collaborate.</li>
    <li>Ensure that researchers get their work distributed as widely as possible so that it can be put to effective use.</li>
</ul>

      <h4>What Gamayun and CISRR are Not</h4>

      <p><b>We are not gatekeeping.</b> Anyone who wants to get into security in general and security research in particular should be encouraged to do so and given all the support possible. This is not about 'you must be this tall to join the club' its about ensuring that those who want to learn have the best resources, and those who want to study understand what's been done and what needs doing.</p>
      
      <p><b>We are not Sci-Hub.</b> While we understand the motivation for such an effort (the racket that is academic publishing), we're not down with piracy. We will work within existing legal regimes to gain the appropriate permissions and rights to use and augment the work of researchers whether they are in academia, industry, or independent.</p>

      <p><b>We are not Academia.edu.</b> We wish we'd been first, but we're grateful for the lessons learned. Gamayun is an IRS 501(c)(3) public charity. There is no VC money behind this project (and the corresponding expectations). At this point we rely on volunteers and donations (and some self-funding).</p>

      <h4>Interested?</h4>

      <p>Starting anything new and sufficiently different is a scary and challenging experience. No one can do it alone and stay healthy (or sane). To succeed, Gamayun needs help from a wide variety of people: researchers, engineers, librarians, editors, security practitioners, and of course donors. If you're interested in lending a hand, and getting in on the ground floor, please drop a line to <a href="mailto:support@gamayun.org">support@gamayun.org</a></p>
