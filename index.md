#### Why does the world need Gamayun in the first place?

Our relationship with computing technology has never been more pervasive or persistent. Computers used to take up whole buildings, then rooms, then merely desktops. Today laptops, handhelds, wearables, and implantables (medical devices) are commonplace. The safety and security of that technology is becoming a matter of grave importance.

Yet not a week goes by without someone talking about a 'new' idea, that was really something someone else had come up with five years prior, that was an extension of something someone else had done 10 years before that. As security practitioners we like to think we're scientific, yet when it comes to some basic practices like being able to discover and assess prior art we're far behind the curve. We have decades of history to draw upon and help inform our thinking, decisions, and action but to borrow a line from J.R.R. Tolkien: 

> “And some things that should not have been forgotten were lost. History became legend. Legend became myth...”

Without a concerted effort to capture and make accessible security research and history, we condemn ourselves to perpetual wheel-reinvention. Conferences and their proceedings are not archives, and they have a tendancy to come and go. People take down web sites and GitHub repos for various reasons. <a href="https://archive.org/web/">The Wayback Machine</a> doesn't capture everything, and we shouldn't have to rely on a general purpose archiving effort to preserve such an important set of information. 

My name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mtanji/">Mike,</a> and I've been involved in security in one way shape or form for almost 30 years. I'm done wishing and hoping someone else would do what needs to be done on these issues.
